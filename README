NAME
    HTML::Entities::Numbered - Conversion of numbered HTML entities

SYNOPSIS
     use HTML::Entities::Numbered;
 
     $html = 'Hi Honey<b>&hearts;</b>';
 
     # convert named HTML entities to numbered (decimal)
     $decimal = name2decimal($html);    # Hi Honey<b>&#9829;</b>
 
     # to numbered (hexadecimal)
     $hex     = name2hex($html);        # Hi Honey<b>&#x2665;</b>
 
     $content    = 'Copyright &#169; Larry Wall';
 
     # convert numbered HTML entities (decimal) to named
     $name1   = decimal2name($content); # Copyright &copy; Larry Wall
 
     $content    = 'Copyright &#xA9; Larry Wall';
     # convert numbered HTML entitites (hexadecimal) to named
     $name2   = hex2name($content);     # Copyright &copy; Larry Wall

DESCRIPTION
    HTML::Entities::Numbered is a subclass of HTML::Entities. It is a
    content conversion filter for named HTML entities (symbols, mathmetical
    symbols, Greek letters, Latin letters, etc.). When an argument of
    "name2decimal()" or "name2hex()" contains some nameable HTML entities,
    they will be replaced to numbered HTML entities. By the same token, when
    an argument of "decimal2name()" or "hex2name()" contains some nameable
    numbered HTML entities, they will be replaced to named HTML entities.

    The entities hash table is imported from HTML::Entities. However, this
    module doesn't work correctly for earlier releases of Perl 5.7.0. If
    this module is used with the older, it will be exported extra hash table
    from HTML::Entities::Numbered::Extra for conversion correctness.

    This bay be also useful for making XML (corrects the undefined entity
    references).

FUNCTIONS
    Following all functions are exported by default.

    * name2decimal
        Some included named HTML entities in argument of "name2decimal()"
        will be replaced to decimal numbered HTML entities.

    * name2hex
        Some included named HTML entities in argument of "name2decimal()"
        will be replaced to hexadecimal numbered HTML entities.

    * decimal2name
        Some include decimal numbered HTML entities in argument of
        "decimal2name()" will be replaced to named HTML entities (If they're
        nameable).

    * hex2name
        Some include hexadecimal numbered HTML entities in argument of
        "decimal2name()" will be replaced to named HTML entities (If they're
        nameable).

    If you'd prefer not to import them functions into the caller's
    namespace, you can call them as below:

     use HTML::Entities::Numbered ();
 
     $decimal = HTML::Entities::Numbered::name2decimal($str);
     $hex     = HTML::Entities::Numbered::name2hex($str);
     $named1  = HTML::Entities::Numbered::decimal2name($str);
     $named2  = HTML::Entities::Numbered::hex2name($str);

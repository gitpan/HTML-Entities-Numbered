NAME
    HTML::Entities::Numbered - Conversion of numbered HTML entities

SYNOPSIS
     use HTML::Entities::Numbered;
 
     $html    = 'Hi Honey<b>&hearts;</b>';
 
     # convert named HTML entities to numbered (decimal)
     $decimal = name2decimal($html);    # Hi Honey<b>&#9829;</b>
 
     # to numbered (hexadecimal)
     $hex     = name2hex($html);        # Hi Honey<b>&#x2665;</b>
 
     $content = 'Copyright &#169; Larry Wall';
 
     # convert numbered HTML entities (decimal) to named
     $name1   = decimal2name($content); # Copyright &copy; Larry Wall
 
     $content = 'Copyright &#xA9; Larry Wall';
     # convert numbered HTML entitites (hexadecimal) to named
     $name2   = hex2name($content);     # Copyright &copy; Larry Wall
 
     $xml     = '&quot;Give me &yen;10,000&quot; &gt; cherie&spades;';
 
     # convert named HTML entities to numbered
     # except valid XML entities (decimal)
     $decimal = name2decimal_xml($xml); # &quot;Give me &#165;10,000&quot;
                                        # &gt; cherie&#9824;
 
     # to numbered except valid XML entities (hexdecimal)
     $hex     = name2hex_xml($xml);     # &quot;Give me &#xA5;10,000&quot;
                                        # &gt; cherie&#x2660;

DESCRIPTION
    HTML::Entities::Numbered is a content conversion filter for named HTML
    entities (symbols, mathmetical symbols, Greek letters, Latin letters,
    etc.). When an argument of "name2decimal()" or "name2hex()" contains
    some nameable HTML entities, they will be replaced to numbered HTML
    entities. And when an argument of "name2decimal_xml()" or
    "name2hex_xml()" contains some nameable numbered HTML entities, they
    will be replaced to numbered HTML entities except valid XML entities
    (the excepted "valid XML entities" are the following five entities:
    "&lt;", "&gt;", "&amp;", "&quot;", "&apos;"). By the same token, when an
    argument of "decimal2name()" or "hex2name()" contains some nameable
    numbered HTML entities, they will be replaced to named HTML entities.

    (the exception "valid XML entities" means the following five entities:
    "&lt;", "&gt;", "&amp;", "&quot;", "&apos;")

    On version 0.03, the entities hash table is imported from HTML::Entities
    (with obsolete class "HTML::Entities::Numbered::Extra" for older
    releases of Perl). At the moment, 0.04 (or later) is included
    HTML::Entities::Numbered::Table to import HTML entities table, and
    thereby we do not need to have HTML::Entities (included in HTML::Parser
    distribution).

    This may be also useful for making valid XML (corrects the undefined
    entity references, and enhanced by addition of functions conform to the
    XML).

FUNCTIONS
    Following all functions are exported by default.

    * name2decimal
        Some included named HTML entities in argument of "name2decimal()"
        will be replaced to decimal numbered HTML entities.

    * name2hex
        Some included named HTML entities in argument of "name2hex()" will
        be replaced to hexadecimal numbered HTML entities.

    * decimal2name
        Some include decimal numbered HTML entities in argument of
        "decimal2name()" will be replaced to named HTML entities (If they're
        nameable).

    * hex2name
        Some include hexadecimal numbered HTML entities in argument of
        "hex2name()" will be replaced to named HTML entities (If they're
        nameable).

    * name2decimal_xml
        Some included named HTML entities in argument of
        "name2decimal_xml()" will be replaced to decimal numbered HTML
        entities except valid XML entities.

    * name2hex_xml
        Some included named HTML entities in argument of "name2hex_xml()"
        will be replaced to hexadecimal numbered HTML entities except valid
        XML entities.

    If you'd prefer not to import them functions into the caller's
    namespace, you can call them as below:

     use HTML::Entities::Numbered ();
 
     $decimal = HTML::Entities::Numbered::name2decimal($str);
     $hex     = HTML::Entities::Numbered::name2hex($str);
     $named1  = HTML::Entities::Numbered::decimal2name($str);
     $named2  = HTML::Entities::Numbered::hex2name($str);
     $decimal = HTML::Entities::Numbered::name2decimal_xml($str);
     $hex     = HTML::Entities::Numbered::name2hex_xml($str);
